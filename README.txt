MATH TREE
____________________
This was a project for one of my C++ courses, where the main object 
was to implement a data tree for a text based calculator. It parses a
file and recieves each char as a token which is then passed into a state 
machine where it proceeds until finally constructing one of the words, 
where it then calls a function to carry out the assigned task. 


Student Objects
____________________
This was another project for one of my C++ courses mainly involving objects
as well as operator overloading. There are also functions to deal with sorting 
the students and whatnot.
