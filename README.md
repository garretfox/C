MATH TREE
____________________
This was a project for one of my C++ courses, where the main object 
was to implement a data tree for a text based calculator. It parses a
file and recieves each char as a token which is then passed into a state 
machine where it proceeds until finally constructing one of the words, 
where it then calls a function to carry out the assigned task. Most of the 
code done by me were the functions to make sure the parser would accurately 
gather the tokens and some functions dealing with the state table. 

**Much of the framework for the tree was made by our professor, Bill Slater**. 


Student Objects
____________________
This was another project for one of my C++ courses mainly involving objects
as well as operator overloading. There are also functions to deal with sorting 
the students and whatnot. 

Most of this was done by me as it was not too complex.

Personal attempt to refresh some basic C++. Most of the code was made within 3hrs.
I had some trouble with checking to see if four player pieces were connected as it 
wasn't working as I'd hoped at first. After some testing I finally resolved the 
issues.
